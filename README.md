_[R]econfigured [U]niversal [B]lue [OS]_

A personalised version of bazzite(https://bazzite.gg/) published by the Universal Blue Project(https://universal-blue.org/), utilising their image-template(https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template) for building custom [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) images.

Aside from additional base packages, homebrew formulae and flatpaks, the most notable addition is VirtualBox & it's extention pack. Credit for that build script goes to ettfemnio(https://github.com/ettfemnio/bazzite-virtualbox).

Further inspiration was derived from the various community examples as listed at the bottom of the ublue-os image-template.
